Preserving data
===============
A library for your data
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Preservation marks a maturity level that allows to begin the data life cycle
again in new research endeavors.

BCO-DMO serves as a domain specific, intermediate data repository, and as such
does not function as a long-term archive for data preservation. BCO-DMO
provides data management support throughout the period of performance of a
project award, which prepares project output for reuse and reanalysis by the
community.

Risk of inaccessibility or data loss is mitigated via two strategies:
through the **harvest and replication of data by DataONE**, an NSF-funded data
aggregation entity that maintains a copy of the data; and through **deposition
of data to BCO-DMO’s institutional library (MBL-WHOI Library)** for **acquisition
of digital object identifiers (DOIs)**. The library maintains an immutable copy
of each version of data for which a DOI is obtained.

BCO-DMO’s **long-term preservation strategy** is achieved through a relationship
with an appropriate National Archive. Once data files have been processed,
published via the BCO-DMO website, deposited in the Institutional library,
and harvested by DataONE, they are then deposited with the National Centers
for Environmental Information (NCEI), a digital data archive of the National
Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), serving oceanography,
geography and climate communities.  These multiple redundancies and intentional
archiving assure that BCO-DMO data will persist through unplanned lapses, or
cessation of the repository project.
