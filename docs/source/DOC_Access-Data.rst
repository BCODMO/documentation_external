Discovering data
=================
Once data are processed and published online, the BCO-DMO website enables data discovery
via text and geospatial search interefaces, making it easy for users to find datasets of
choice.

Through text-based searches, the database can be searched by cruise, project, person, or any keyword
provided in metadata upon submission. Access to data is made possible from the Dataset Landing Pages,
and data may be subsetted, plotted an reformatted prior to download. The BCO-DMO database encompasses
the full range of oceanographic measurement types from lomnological, physical, chemical, biological
and/or ecological and biogeochemical sub-domains

Citing data and the use of a DOI
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Why is data citation so important?
BCO-DMO works closely together with DataCite (https://datacite.org/index.html)

Available formats
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Data can be downloaded from BCO-DMO as tab-, comma-, and space-separated ASCII files,
Matlab binary files, netCDF format (if the data are amenable to this format), and
ODV format (if the data are amenable to this format). Data can also be accessed using
Open Geospatial Consortiumâ€™s (OGC) Web Mapping Service (WMS) and Web Feature Service (WFS)
through our MapServer interface. For more information on finding and downloading data using
the BCO-DMO data system, please refer to our Data Access Tutorial (PDF).
