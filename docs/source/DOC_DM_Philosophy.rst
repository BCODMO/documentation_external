Open Data
==========
The inherent value that data hold to the research process cannot be overstated, and existing
data hold great potential to **accelerate scientific discovery through reuse once shared**.

The concept of open data, data that are publicly and freely discoverable, accessible, and reusable,
has been steadily gaining momentum in the scientific community: “Open data is like a renewable
energy source: it can be reused without diminishing its original value, and reuse creates new value.” (Science et al., 2017).

Realizing the value of open data within the scientific research landscape, several
stakeholders from funders to journal publishers, are driving change in the culture of data
sharing (Mayernik, 2012, Costas et al., 2013; NSF17-037, 2017; Holdren, 2013). With this shift,
many digital data repositories have come online to provide data management services that
meet stakeholder needs for data discovery and access.

However, in order for data to be reused efficiently and effectively, they must also be
**well managed and stewarded**. Here, domain-specific repositories add great value to their
community’s research data by bringing subject matter expertise to the curation process (Lenhert, 2015; ICPSR, 2013).


Data Life Cycle
================
Curating and providing open access to research data is a collaborative process.
This process may be thought of as a life cycles with data passing through various phases.
Each phase has its own associated actores, roles and critical activities. Good
data management practices are necessary for all phases, from proposal to preservation.

FAIR principles
===============
BCO-DMO aligns its data stewardship philosophy with the F.A.I.R. Data Principles (Wilkinson et al, 2016),
which have gained significant attention within the data management landscape over the recent years. These
principles outline tangible practices data providers can employ to promote easier sharing and ultimate reuse
of data by both machines and humans, thereby making them **"Findable, Accessible, Interoperable and Reusable"**.
