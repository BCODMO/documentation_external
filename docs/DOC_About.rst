Mission
=======
The Biological and Chemical Oceanography Data Management Office (BCO-DMO) was created to serve principal investigators funded by the National Science Foundation (NSF) Biological and Chemical Oceanography Sections and Division of Polar Programs Antarctic Organisms & Ecosystems Program as a facility where marine biogeochemical and ecological data and information developed in the course of scientific research can easily be disseminated, protected, and stored on short and intermediate time-frames.  The Data Management Office also provides research scientists and others with the tools and systems necessary to work with marine biogeochemical and ecological data from heterogeneous sources with increased efficacy.
