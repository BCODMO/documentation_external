Prepare using a Data Management Plan
=====================================================
What is a Data Management Plan?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The start of the data life cycle begins with a plan, conveniently called
a data management plan.

Proposals submitted to NSF must include a supplementary document of no more
than two pages labeled “Data Management Plan” (DMP). This supplementary
document should describe how the proposal will conform to NSF’s policy
on the dissemination and sharing of research results.

Investigators working under awards granted by the NSF Division of Ocean Sciences
(OCE) have additional conditions to which they must adhere, as described in
the `Division of Ocean Sciences Sample and Data Policy`_.

We can help!
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
BCO-DMO has developed a Data Management Plan template to assist investigators
in submission of plans that meet the NSF OCE Sample and Data Policy
requirements. The template can be found and completed on the DMPTool website.

`DMPTool`_ is a free, open-source, online application that helps
researchers create data management plans. The DMPTool provides detailed
guidance and links to informational resources and walks researchers through
the process of generating comprehensive plans tailored to specific DMP
requirements, in this case, the NSF OCE requirements.

If you are a researcher from one of the DMPTool partner institutions, you can
log in using your institutional credentials. If your institution is not a
partner, you can create your own account using any email address.

In each section of the DMP template, you will see instructions containing
the question or a description of information that should be provided to meet
the specific requirement. Each question/requirement also has an example answer
and links to additional guidance. The plan may be saved at any point, and can
also be shared with collaborators. Once complete, your DMP can be exported in
several different formats for inclusion in your NSF proposal.
