This page describes the process for contributing metadata and data from appropriate NSF OCE funded projects to the BCO-DMO data system. If you would like to discuss management of data associated with an existing or proposed project, please contact us (info@bco-dmo.org). For funded projects, please be prepared to provide your NSF OCE award number.

PROPOSED STEPS:

1. Determine if BCO-DMO is the correct repository for your project and data submission
2. Visit BCO-DMO and download appropriate metadata forms
3. Prepare data files and metadata forms
4. Email ‘info@bco-dmo’ attaching data files and forms
5. Work with Data Manager to review and validate your published data e

Draft Proposed Steps for Data Contributors:
Evaluate: Determine if BCO-DMO is the correct repository for your project and data submission
Register: Register your project (form link): (we don’t think we need to make public the program info. If we determine that the project is part of a program, we’ll initiate it.
Contribute: Contribute data
Prepare: Prepare data files and metadata forms
Submit: Email ‘info@bco-dmo’ attaching data files and forms (describe in the text how to handle big files)
Collaborate: Work with Data Manager to publish the data and metadata (iterative - use circular graphic)
Validate: Review and validate your published data… in details: After validation, you have the opportunity to create a new data version if need be....(dotted line)  (mention doi option)


Evaluate: Determine if BCO-DMO is the correct repository for your project and data submission
==============================================================================================
You should contribute data to BCO-DMO if your project is funded by **NSF OCE's Biological or Chemical Oceanography Sections** or the **Division of Polar Programs' Antarctic Organisms & Ecosystems Program**.
BCO-DMO provides data management services at no additional cost to projects funded by NSF's Division of Ocean Sciences' Biological and Chemical Oceanography Sections and the Division of Polar Programs' Antarctic Organisms & Ecosystems Program. BCO-DMO staff members work with researchers funded by these NSF programs to ensure that data and metadata contributed to tBCO-DMO are in compliance with the current NSF OCE Sample and Data Policy (May 2011 version; PDF). To contribute data to BCO-DMO, please see Section II of this page, “How to contribute data to BCO-DMO.”









Can I contribute data to BCO-DMO?
---------------------------------
We are funded by NSF OCE, that is why we only take those...

Registering a project
---------------------
Before being able to contribute your data to BCO-DMO, your NSF project needs to be registered. Using the project registration tempplate which contains questions about the metadata.
In case of a collaborative project

Submitting data
-----------------------
A project would need to be registered first
send to info@bcodmo.org
