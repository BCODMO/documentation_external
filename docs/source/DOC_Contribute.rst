This page describes the process for contributing metadata
and data from appropriate NSF OCE funded projects to the BCO-DMO data system.

If you would like to discuss management of data associated with an existing or
proposed project, please contact us (info@bco-dmo.org). For funded projects, please
be prepared to provide your NSF OCE award number.



Evaluate
========
Is BCO-DMO the right repository for you? BCO-DMO provides data management services at no additional cost to projects funded
by NSF's Division of Ocean Sciences' Biological and Chemical Oceanography Sections and the
Division of Polar Programs' Antarctic Organisms & Ecosystems Program.

BCO-DMO staff members work with researchers funded by these NSF programs to ensure that data and
metadata contributed to BCO-DMO are in compliance with the current NSF OCE Sample and Data Policy
(May 2011 version; PDF).

Below are other suggested data management centers if your project is not funded by an NSF section that
BCO-DMO serves:

* For **NSF-sponsored Physical Oceanography** projects, investigators are encouraged to contact
  the CLIVAR and Carbon Hydrographic Data Office (CCHDO) or archive their data directly
  with the National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI).
* For **marine geology**, contact the Interdisciplinary Earth Data Alliance (IEDA) group
  hosted at Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory, Columbia University.
* For projects supported by **NSF Arctic Sciences Program (ARC)** investigators,
  the Arctic Data Center which succeeds the Advanced Cooperative Arctic Data and Information Service (ACADIS),
  should be contacted. The Arctic Data Center is supported by NSF and is led by the
  National Center for Ecological Analysis and Synthesis (NCEAS) at the University of California Santa Barbara,
  to develop and curate the NSF Arctic Data Center, an archive for Arctic scientific data as well as other related
  research documents.
* **Gulf of Mexico Research Initiative (GoMRI)** funded projects can submit data tso their regional GoMRI location.
  See https://data.gulfresearchinitiative.org/about for additional information including their data
  management plan under the "Design and Management" menu option.
* **OCB research community**: Guidance to OCB scientists who are uncertain where to submit or propose to
  submit their data is available from the OCB website.


Register
========
A (collaborative) project
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A. Complete a Project Metadata Form (.rtf) to provide information about projects that are not already registered at BCO-DMO.

  * A project oversees a collection of one or more datasets.
  * A project may or may not be part of a larger program.
  * There is most often one project per NSF award, with the exception of Collaborative Research awards where one project is funded by multiple award numbers.
  * If you do not yet know the NSF award number, please provide as much information as possible including the project title and investigator contact information.

B. Submit the Project Metadata Form along with your NSF Data Management Plan, Deployment Metadata Form(s) (if applicable), and Dataset Metadata Form(s) to info@bco-dmo.org.

An NSF designated program
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A. Complete a Program Metadata Form (.rtf) to describe a large coordinated research program that is not already registered at BCO-DMO.
Programs usually encompass one or more projects.
Examples of Programs include U.S. JGOFS, U.S. GLOBEC, U.S. OCB, and U.S. GEOTRACES.

B. Submit the Program Metadata Form along with your NSF Data Management Plan, Project Metadata Form, Deployment Metadata Form(s) (if applicable), and Dataset Metadata Form(s) to info@bco-dmo.org.



Prepare
=======
Prepare your data files. All datasets, projects and deployments submitted to BCO-DMO should be contributed along with the appropriate metadata forms.
Forms are Rich Text Format (.rtf) files that are compatible with any word processing application. A description and download link
to each form can be found below.


Deployments
~~~~~~~~~~~
1. Complete a Deployment Metadata Form (.rtf) to provide information about a specific cruise, mooring, laboratory, or some
other unique experience of data collection or analysis.

  * Complete this form if it is applicable to the dataset(s) you are submitting.
  * Deployments help to describe the geographic and temporal scale of datasets.
  * Deployments provide context for mapping the associated data.

2. Submit the Deployment Metadata Form along with the Dataset Metadata Form(s) to info@bco-dmo.org.

Data
~~~~
A. Complete a Dataset Metadata Form (.rtf) along with your data to provide information about each unique
dataset collected within a project.

  * A Dataset Metadata Form should be completed for each dataset contributed to BCO-DMO.
  * Please send us your processed data when pertaining to acoustics, CTDs, and ADCPs.
  * We accept data in any format, but comma- or tab-delimited (preferred) ASCII files or Excel spreadsheets are most common
  * If contributing data as an Excel file, please see our tips for submitting data in a spreadsheet.
  * Sequence accession numbers and the associated data can be contributed to BCO-DMO and we can provide links to the sequence repository (such as NCBI's GenBank). Please see "Contributing Sequence Accession Numbers" for more information.
  * Most datasets can be contributed as email attachments along with their respective completed Dataset Metadata Form.
  * If the data set is too large to contribute as an email attachment, please contact our office for instructions on the best way to contribute your data.

B. Submit Dataset Metadata Form(s) and all data files to info@bco-dmo.org.

Submit

Collaborate
===========
After we receive your data and metadata, a data manager will begin the process of making the data available online. Data managers may
contact you with follow-up questions or to obtain feedback. We strive to develop robust metadata that will ensure the data are easily
discoverable and reusable. Your Data Manager will contact you with follow-up questions or requests for more information to ensure that the
metadata is complete. This may be an itirative process, so your patience and cooperation are greatly appreciated.


Validate
========
Once your datasets are online, you will be asked to review the data and metadata for completeness and accuracy.
This validation stage is the final step in the process, and necessary for assignment of a DOI and long-term archive.
