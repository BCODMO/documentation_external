  submissions. All datasets must be final and validated before a DOI is
  assigned.
* We provide a recommended **citation**, so that users can proberly cite each
  dataset.
* All datasets available at BCO-DMO are **licensed** under a **Creative Commons

  will receive proper credit.
* Every DOI is minted for **archive** by the WHOI Open Access Server (WHOAS),
