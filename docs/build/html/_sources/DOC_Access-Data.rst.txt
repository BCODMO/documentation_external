Accessing data
===============
Once data are processed and published online, the BCO-DMO website enables data discovery
via text and geospatial search interefaces, making it easy for users to find datasets of
choice.

Through text-based searches, the database can be searched by cruise, project, person, or any keyword
provided in metadata upon submission. Access to data is made possible from the Dataset Landing Pages,
and data may be subsetted, plotted an reformatted prior to download. The BCO-DMO database encompasses
the full range of oceanographic measurement types from lomnological, physical, chemical, biological
and/or ecological and biogeochemical sub-domains
