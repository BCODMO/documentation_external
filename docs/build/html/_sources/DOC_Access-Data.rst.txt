Discovering
===========
Once data are processed and published online, the BCO-DMO website enables data
discovery via text and geospatial search interefaces, making it easy for users
to find datasets of choice.

Through text-based searches, the database can be searched by cruise, project,
person, or any keyword provided in metadata upon submission. Access to data is
made possible from the Dataset Landing Pages,
and data may be subsetted, plotted an reformatted prior to download. The BCO-DMO
database encompasses the full range of oceanographic measurement types from
limnological, physical, chemical, biological and/or ecological and
biogeochemical sub-domains

Citing data and the use of a DOI
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Correctly citing and therefore giving credit to the researcher that made the data
publicly available is one of terms of use. We provide a "get citation" button on
each dataset page for easy use of reserachers. In general citations should include
the following:

 Citations should include the following:

    Principal Investigator (PI) name(s)
    title of dataset
    data version date
    publisher or distributor,
    date accessed/retrieved by you
    DOI or URL of the data set

Available formats
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Data can be downloaded from BCO-DMO as tab-, comma-, and space-separated ASCII
files, Matlab binary files, netCDF format (if the data are amenable to this
format), and ODV format (if the data are amenable to this format). Data can also
be accessed using Open Geospatial Consortium’s (OGC) Web Mapping Service (WMS)
and Web Feature Service (WFS) through our MapServer interface. For more
information on finding and downloading data using the BCO-DMO data system,
please refer to our Data Access Tutorial (PDF).
